# 🎂 Birthday Webpage

> Stop writing cards or posting content on social media to say "Happy Birthday!" <br>

This is a birthday SPA (Single-Page-Application)  using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

I made this website for my girlfriend's birthday and thought that this might help out some frontend boys and girls!
I modified some content to make it more general and easy to configure. 



Feel free to [contact me](mailto:amos70180@gmail.com) for more information or custom designs.

## 💻 Prerequisites
You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 6.0 or greater installed on your system.

## 🔧 Setup

Get the code by either cloning this repository using git

    > git clone https://github.com/amoossssss/birthday_webpage

... or [downloading source code](https://github.com/amoossssss/birthday_webpage/archive/master.zip) code as a zip archive.

Once downloaded, open the terminal in the project directory, and continue with:

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```
Now the website will be running on port 8080:
  >  http://localhost:8080

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

## 📝 Customize configuration

Find all the TODO tags in the code to configure this webpage.

Including : 

1. Landing page's content
2. Messages page's content and images
3. Video page's YouTube video
4. Stories behind page's content

Reminder : <br>
&emsp; * You have to add a onLoad function to every image added in the Messages page to make the page loader work.<br>
&emsp; * There are some dummy imgaes in the page to display the loader functionality and transition effect.<br>
&emsp; * Just copy  ``` @load="onImgLoad" ``` and paste it to the el-image tags you added.<br>
&emsp; * Also be careful of the ``` totalImages ``` variable in the same page, make sure it is consistant to your design.
